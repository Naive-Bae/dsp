[Think Stats Chapter 2 Exercise 4](http://greenteapress.com/thinkstats2/html/thinkstats2003.html#toc24) (Cohen's d)

Using the variable `totalwgt_lb`, investigate whether first babies are lighter or heavier than others.

Compute Cohenâ€™s effect size to quantify the difference between the groups. How does it compare to the difference in pregnancy length?

`[In]  CohenEffectSize(firsts.totalwgt_lb, others.totalwgt_lb)`

`[Out]  -0.088672927072602`

We see above that although there is a small tendency for first babies to gestate longer on average than other babies, their weight tends to be slightly less.
